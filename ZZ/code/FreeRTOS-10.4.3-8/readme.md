## Usage & Further Reading

Read the short blog post on [FreeRTOS](https://feilipu.me/2015/11/24/FreeRTOS/) to get started. And there is another much older post on using [FreeRTOS with AVR](https://feilipu.me/2011/09/22/freertos-and-libraries-for-avr-atmega/), which may be useful to read too. There are some further posts I've written on [Hackster.IO](https://www.hackster.io/feilipu), but they're essentially the same content.


My other [AVRfreeRTOS Sourceforge Repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avrfreertos/) or [AVRfreeRTOS Github](https://github.com/feilipu/avrfreertos) has plenty of examples, ranging from [blink](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avrfreertos/files/MegaBlink/) through to a [synthesiser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avrfreertos/files/GA_Synth/).

This library was the genesis of [generalised support for the ATmega platform within FreeRTOS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel/pull/48).

## General




Watchdog period options:
* `WDTO_15MS`
* `WDTO_30MS`
* `WDTO_60MS`
* `WDTO_120MS`
* `WDTO_250MS`
* `WDTO_500MS`
* `WDTO_1S`
* `WDTO_2S`

Note that Timer resolution is affected by integer math division and the time slice selected. Trying to measure 50ms, using a 120ms time slice for example, won't work.

Memory for the heap is allocated by the normal `malloc()` function, wrapped by `pvPortMalloc()`.
This option has been selected because it is automatically adjusted to use the capabilities of each device.
Other heap allocation schemes are supported by FreeRTOS, and they can used with additional configuration.

## Upgrading

* [Upgrading to FreeRTOS-9](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-V9.html)
* [Upgrading to FreeRTOS-10](https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-V10.html)

## Errors

* Stack Overflow: If any stack (for the `loop()` or) for any Task overflows, there will be a slow LED blink, with 4 second cycle.
* Heap Overflow: If any Task tries to allocate memory and that allocation fails, there will be a fast LED blink, with 100 millisecond cycle.

## Errata

Testing with the Software Serial library shows some incompatibilities at low baud rates (9600), due to the extended time this library disables the global interrupt. Use the hardware USARTs.


  
The new megaAVR 0-Series devices (eg. ATmega4809) are not fully compatible with this library. Their Timer configuration is substantially different from previous devices, and forms part of a new __avr8x__ architecture. It may be a while until avr-libc is updated to include support for megaAVR devices, but when that happens further work will be added here.

## Files & Configuration

* `FreeRTOS.h` : Must always be `#include` first. It references other configuration files, and sets defaults where necessary.
* `FreeRTOSConfig.h` : Contains a multitude of API and environment configurations.
* `FreeRTOSVariant.h` : Contains the AVR specific configurations for this port of freeRTOS.
* `heap_3.c` : Contains the heap allocation scheme based on `malloc()`. Other schemes are available, but depend on user configuration for specific MCU choice.

### PlatformIO

Watchdog period is configurable using build-flags:

```python
build_flags =
  -DportUSE_WDTO=WDTO_15MS
```
